Denton Nelson, Yesterday 11:28 AM
Fusion has been just 20 years away for the last 50 years. We might need something else until it gets here in just 20 years.

Paul Willey, Yesterday 11:30 AM
Fusion is probably ages away, if I see working stable Fusion reactors before I die of old age I'll be surprised.

Paul Willey, Yesterday 11:33 AM
Me when Fusion actually works

Bryant Jackson, Yesterday 11:38 AM
Well, there was a major breakthrough last December, so it might not be so much of a pipe dream from where we are now. For the first time, they actually produced more energy from the fusion reaction than what was used to power the laser for the fusion ignition

Sean Haring, Yesterday 11:40 AM

Paul Willey, Yesterday 11:46 AM, Edited
Yes Bryant but if you count total energy involved they still expended 5 times the energy produced. It's a step forward but only a tiny one.

Cody Powell, Yesterday 11:46 AM
One small step for man.

Terra Envy, Yesterday 11:48 AM
It's a much bigger step than that. It's the first time we have ever had success on fusion ignition.
Once there is success, they can attempt to replicate, scale things as needed, and optimize.

It's actually a huge step even if it wasn't a huge output compared to total input.

Terra Envy, Yesterday 11:48 AM, Edited
Rarely are first successes on things like this something massive, it's usually smaller then snowballs to be more.

Bryant Jackson, Yesterday 11:49 AM
Yeah, I mean I'd still call it a big step considering it's the proof of concept. But's still just one of many steps

Cody Powell, Yesterday 11:50 AM
Fo sho

Bryant Jackson, Yesterday 11:51 AM
What we'd really need to see is a breakthrough in laser technology before any significant kind of fusion could be produced. But, there are a lot of great scientific minds working on the best possible way to make a laser beam. It's just a matter of whether or not they'll continue to get paid to do so

Everett Baird, Yesterday 11:51 AM
that' ridiculous. i'm with richard

are we really not funding the cool/effective stuff?

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 11:52 AM
Don't worry. This will be Elon Musk's next project. He needs a good fusion reactor for his Mars colony.

Richard Manseau, Yesterday 11:54 AM
why pay them when we could fund  Researching if Thanos could snap his fingers wearing the infinity gauntlet

Paul Willey, Yesterday 11:54 AM
The issue is it still a net loss of energy not a net gain, if it takes 5 gallons of gasoline to make half a gallon of gasoline then you didn't produce anything.

Richard Manseau, Yesterday 11:55 AM
Researchers at Georgia Tech recently got a grant for $118,971 to study whether a real-life Thanos could actually snap his fingers while wearing the Infinity Gauntlet.

Terra Envy, Yesterday 12:00 PM
Yes, that was still a net loss, but you can't ever expect initial breakthrough to be optimized. That comes next.
But that step of a breakthrough is what sets the possibility for the entire field now.

Sean Haring, Yesterday 12:04 PM
Facts. It's like expecting Alexander Bell to make a smart phone on his first try.

Paul Willey, Yesterday 12:06 PM
I'm just saying for the current Fusion Reaction to become viable they have to reduce the energy costs by like 90%, not exactly something that makes it close to viable. Even the people in the industry say 20 years away would be highly optimistic.

Richard Manseau, Yesterday 12:07 PM
Denton Elon already has a idea to terra form mars

Paul Willey, Yesterday 12:11 PM
It's like saying Marie Curie discovered radiation so we can switch over from coal to nuclear, it takes a lot of time to bridge that gap.

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 12:13 PM
Of course he does, Richard. And he's going to need a lot of (fusion) power to make that happen.

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 12:14 PM, Edited
Paul; you're trying so hard to be a contrarian that you don't realize that you are agreeing with Terra.

Sean Haring, Yesterday 12:14 PM
I was gonna say

you just looped right back around to the point she literally made

Richard Manseau, Yesterday 12:16 PM
well paul if we keep spending money on garbage like a $3 million annual research project to watch hamsters on steroids fight,  then we will never make leaps and bounds technology wise

Sean Haring, Yesterday 12:16 PM
Hamtaro will never be the same again

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 12:17 PM
You just need to get your priorities straight, Richard. You really don't appreciate what is important in life.

Paul Willey, Yesterday 12:17 PM
Nope, I'm saying the opposite. I'm saying it's a needed step in the right direction but there are many other more significant breakthroughs needed.

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 12:18 PM
Which, again, is what Terra was saying...

Logan Burr, Yesterday 12:20 PM
Terra = :big-brain-time:

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 12:21 PM
It seems that Terra has Paul chasing his own tail.

Sean Haring, Yesterday 12:27 PM
I'm glad we have this chat, I've never been so entertained at work.

Paul Willey, Yesterday 12:28 PM, Edited
See, she was saying it's a big step forward which it isn't because all the things needed to make it viable are much more significant changes and in this particular case they don't even depend on this breakthru to make the more significant progress thats still needed.

Logan Burr, Yesterday 12:28 PM
I think this chat should be called "Paul gets dunked on by Terra"

Paul Willey, Yesterday 12:29 PM
As if

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 12:30 PM
You're trying too hard, Paul.

Logan Burr, Yesterday 12:30 PM
yep, Terra hasnt even said anything in 30 min

she just let Denton argue for her

Sean Haring, Yesterday 12:31 PM
She's probably doing actually important things

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 12:31 PM
And she's still winning.

Sean Haring, Yesterday 12:31 PM
What a legend

Paul Willey, Yesterday 12:31 PM
Saying she's winning doesn't make it so

Paul Willey, Yesterday 12:31 PM, Edited
No matter how many people say it.

Logan Burr, Yesterday 12:31 PM
we disagree

Truth is in the eye of the beholder.

Sean Haring, Yesterday 12:32 PM
I love Beholders

My favorite one is Large Luigi



Paul Willey, Yesterday 12:34 PM
The last half hour of this debate has been me backing up my argument and everyone else saying "No, LOL"...

Logan Burr, Yesterday 12:34 PM


Bryant Jackson, Yesterday 12:36 PM
Looking at the reaction in isolation, they managed to utilize the latent energy of an atom and produce 130% of the energy required to create the reaction. Which sounds like an amazing achievement to me. For sure It's not the whole picture, though. But no one's saying that a nuclear utopia is just around the corner, just that we've figured out how to work with propellents, and now we can build a rocket

Sean Haring, Yesterday 12:38 PM
That is amazing. Absolute pioneers those lads and lasses.

Paul Willey, Yesterday 12:38 PM
130% of the energy for just the laser involved, total energy expended is like 1,000% of the energy produced.

My whole argument is we aren't that close and this step is very small in comparison to the other steps which could have been completed with or without this breakthru.

Paul Willey, Yesterday 12:43 PM
My grandkids could graduate from college before we make it there. There are physicists making the same argument I am which is that the public and the media are making this breakthru, which is a valuable breakthru, seem bigger than it is.

Everett Baird, Yesterday 12:47 PM
dude be positive

why be a cynic?

it's also not even realism

Logan Burr, Yesterday 12:48 PM
the media would never blow something out of proportion....

Cody Powell, Yesterday 12:48 PM
Never! I trust the media completely!

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 12:48 PM
If you're always cynical all surprises are good ones.

Sean Haring, Yesterday 12:48 PM
Remember Media Play?

That was a fun store

Cody Powell, Yesterday 12:48 PM
I miss that place

Sean Haring, Yesterday 12:48 PM
I miss them and Incredible Universe

Everett Baird, Yesterday 12:48 PM
that's like the wright brothers flying 100 yards on their first flight

no one thought that 50 years later we'd be on the moon

Paul Willey, Yesterday 12:49 PM
It's not cynical to say, this is a good thing but not as good as they say it is.

Everett Baird, Yesterday 12:49 PM
but they revolutionized the game by attempting and succeeding at their attempt of light

why are you arguing that lmao

Paul Willey, Yesterday 12:50 PM
because instead of debating my argument you're attacking me instead.

Everett Baird, Yesterday 12:50 PM
that didn't answer the question?

Paul Willey, Yesterday 12:51 PM, Edited
I'm defending myself because...I'm being attacked.

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 12:53 PM
About 9 weeks before the Wright bros flight the New York Times included this in an article about heavier than air flight, "
it might be assumed that the flying machine which will really
 fly might be evolved by the combined and continuous efforts of 
mathematicians and mechanicians in from one million to ten million years"

Paul is simply playing the part of the New York Times.

Everett Baird, Yesterday 12:53 PM
forsure. but at this point i'm just curious as to what end your argument reaches ?

why that point to buckle down on ?

no hostility here, i'm just wondering why you're defending this: "It's not cynical to say, this is a good thing but not as good as they say it is."

Paul Willey, Yesterday 12:53 PM
I'm a realist not a cynic

Paul Willey, Yesterday 1:10 PM
Denton the opinion of one New York Times Reporter is not the same as the opinions and beliefs of an entire industry speaking within their own area of expertise.

Logan Burr, Yesterday 1:17 PM
didnt you argue the exact opposite like an hour ago?

Paul Willey, Yesterday 1:19 PM
I don't know what you mean by that, but I definitely didn't say the opposite of that at any point.

Bryant Jackson, Yesterday 1:20 PM
I think there's still debate even within the industry. I can appreciate your wanting to temper expectations, but the reason I think it's significant isn't the promise that a nuclear reactor is just around the corner. It's because 1. It's a strong proof of concept and 2. It gives scientists an end goal to build around and optimize for, so that an efficient reactor can be engineered w/out having to worry about to core science behind it

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 1:26 PM
Thanks, Paul, for clearing that up for me. I don't know what I would do without you.

Everett Baird, Yesterday 1:26 PM
why tho

paul?

Paul Willey, Yesterday 1:33 PM
Let me clarify then, I don't believe there's a single respectable scientist or engineer in the industry who believes it's likely that even on a small scale fusion will be possible to make net positive energy production in at least the next couple decades, or on a large scale that energy produced by Fusion can be delivered to consumers at any time in the next 40 years.
Two of the reasons for this are; 
1. That there are still a lot of breakthroughs needed for the first step listed above.
2. Even after the scientific breakthroughs are achieved there is still a lot required to turn the technology into consumer energy (particularly government regulation, and infrastructure)

Everett Baird, Yesterday 1:36 PM
ratio of initial discovery to actual application and widespread use

it's the same

Logan Burr, Yesterday 1:38 PM
wait... now I know you've said something that is contradictory



wouldnt your opinion be as equally invalid as the media since you yourself aren't an expert in the field?

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 1:40 PM
me checking on this chat right now

Paul Willey, Yesterday 1:45 PM
Logan my argument isn't based off of my feelings, it's based off of scientific fact. I'm not arguing based off of fallacies like most of you are, I actually back up what I'm saying and I don't just change the subject or deflect every time.

Logan Burr, Yesterday 1:46 PM
ok, show me the scientific fact that all experts in that field feel the same way

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 1:48 PM
Also, I would like to know which fallacies that everyone is committing.

Paul Willey, Yesterday 1:52 PM
Logan, facts are things that can be proven, opinions are things that are unprovable. I don't have proof that all those in the industry feel that way but it is provable.

Denton, half of your side of this debate has been Ad Hominem.

Sean Haring, Yesterday 1:53 PM
Who needs Twitter when you have The Thunderdome

Richard Newman, Yesterday 1:54 PM


Logan Burr, Yesterday 1:54 PM
Paul, you are confirming exactly what I said then

Logan Burr, Yesterday 1:55 PM, Edited
if facts can be proven, then you should be able ot prove that every expert in the field agrees. If you cant, then not every expert in that field feels the same way

Paul Willey, Yesterday 1:56 PM
That's not how logic works Logan

Logan Burr, Yesterday 1:56 PM, Edited
which means that my comment of your opinion is as invalid as the media's (based off your own statement) is true

logic was never brought into it PAul

you said scientific FACT

Paul Willey, Yesterday 1:57 PM
Facts are any statements that can be proven true or false.

Logan Burr, Yesterday 1:58 PM
correct and you cannot prove it true or false

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 1:58 PM
Giving you a hard time over being overly argumentative != Ad Hominem. It means that it amuses me how argumentative you are and is not intended to address the other discussion in any way.

Paul Willey, Yesterday 1:58 PM
"The sky is red." is a fact because it can be proven true or false.

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 1:58 PM
Also, a 'fact', by definition, cannot be false.

Logan Burr, Yesterday 1:58 PM
..............................

sorry, facts are statements that can be proven true

Paul Willey, Yesterday 1:59 PM
That's not true Denton, Facts can be true or false.

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 1:59 PM


Denton Nelson, Yesterday 1:59 PM
If it is false it is not a fact. By definition of the word.

Cody Powell, Yesterday 2:00 PM
........? How would a Fact be False?

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:00 PM
looks like facts are only true

which I just proved

with that fact

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 2:00 PM
Facts.

Logan Burr, Yesterday 2:00 PM
PS, you're deflecting off of my comment that your opinion is invalid

based off of your own comments 😀

Paul Willey, Yesterday 2:01 PM
No Logan I already addressed that comment.

Logan Burr, Yesterday 2:01 PM
you didnt though

you have not said one single thing that is factual in your defense of what I deduced from your own comments

other than, "the proof is out there"

if you are not able to back up your own scientific claims with scientific proof (as the media does) then your opinion is equal to what they are saying

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:03 PM
perhaps it's time to move onto a new topic

Richard Newman, Yesterday 2:03 PM


Bryant Jackson, Yesterday 2:03 PM
Haha well this has become very meta...

Ryan Marchant, Yesterday 2:03 PM
No trevor, it is movie time

Logan Burr, Yesterday 2:04 PM


Denton Nelson, Yesterday 2:04 PM


Sean Haring, Yesterday 2:05 PM
Cat version of Sisyphus.

Paul Willey, Yesterday 2:08 PM
My argument is not an opinion, because opinions are not testable. I'm not using the common usage when I say fact or opinion, I'm talking from a scientific side. In science fact and opinion are differentiated by if it is possible to prove them one way or the other.



Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:08 PM
Fact: In science, an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as “true.”

that's from the National Center forScience Education

so also cannot be false

opinions also can absolutely be proven falst

and be tested

Richard Newman, Yesterday 2:10 PM


Ryan Marchant, Yesterday 2:10 PM


Paul Willey, Yesterday 2:10 PM
Before the scientific process can begin you have to verify whether or not the things you are trying to test can be proven true/false or not, at this point Fact is anything testable opinion is anything not testable or provable.

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:11 PM
you have those backwards

you create a hypothosis (opintion or what you think will happen) and then try to prove it as fact or false

Paul Willey, Yesterday 2:13 PM
My opinion is that Chocolate is the best flavor of ice cream, if opinions are provable then prove my opinion true or false

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:13 PM
ok go poll everyone on the planet and check the results

Logan Burr, Yesterday 2:13 PM
we arent the ones who want to prove that true or false

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:13 PM
if Chocolate is ahead then its proven

Paul Willey, Yesterday 2:13 PM
Polls of opinion don't prove facts

Ryan Marchant, Yesterday 2:14 PM
Facts

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:14 PM
that depends on what you're trying to prove

Logan Burr, Yesterday 2:14 PM
it would be up to you to prove your own hypothesis true or false

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:14 PM
and how you measure "best"

Paul Willey, Yesterday 2:14 PM
Logan it was an example

Ryan Marchant, Yesterday 2:15 PM
hmmm

Paul Willey, Yesterday 2:16 PM
You're just arguing my point now Trevor. "Best" is valid in an opinion but not testable.

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:16 PM
right, that doesnt make it a fact

show us the definition

Richard Newman, Yesterday 2:16 PM
forming words with my mouth

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:17 PM
I can have the opinion that my car is the fastest in the parking lot and we could test that to see if it's fact or not

Ryan Marchant, Yesterday 2:17 PM
facts

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:17 PM
but it would not be a fact until proven as we see in science

Richard Newman, Yesterday 2:17 PM


Paul Willey, Yesterday 2:17 PM
That's what I' saying Trevor, "Chocolate is the best flavor of ice cream" is an opinion and can't be proven true or false because it's based on personal preference.

Ryan Marchant, Yesterday 2:18 PM
Poll time

Sean Haring, Yesterday 2:18 PM


Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:18 PM
if you measure it by sales or polls it can be proven though

just depends on how you define "best"

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 2:18 PM
What we have here is a difference of opinion on whether opinions are provable. Would submit that it depends on the opinion.

Richard Newman, Yesterday 2:18 PM
Trevor you are the BEST is fact

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:18 PM
that's provable

Paul Willey, Yesterday 2:18 PM
"my car is the fastest in the parking lot" is a fact because it can be tested. My car would lose because for me that is an incorrect fact.

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:19 PM
facts are only true

I've given you 2 definitions for that already

Richard Newman, Yesterday 2:19 PM
anyways strawberry shakes are my favorite

Paul Willey, Yesterday 2:19 PM
Most popular is not the same as best.

Cody Powell, Yesterday 2:19 PM
Mint Chocolate Chip shakes are my fave

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:19 PM
show me an expert's definition that says facts can be false

cause Iv'e already shown them say the opposite

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 2:20 PM
This is why I can't take Paul seriously. He'll continue to argue a point after he has been proven to be incorrect.

He's just a master troll.

Richard Newman, Yesterday 2:20 PM
paul = troll



Everett Baird, Yesterday 2:21 PM


oxford definition

Ryan Marchant, Yesterday 2:21 PM
😯

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 2:22 PM
Well, if Oxford says it, it must be a fact.

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:22 PM
that's 3 definitions now showing it has to be true

Cody Powell, Yesterday 2:22 PM
I'm a Webster guy myself

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 2:23 PM
Webster is for the common people.

Ryan Marchant, Yesterday 2:23 PM
Thoughts Paul?

Richard Newman, Yesterday 2:23 PM


Cody Powell, Yesterday 2:23 PM
Oooh right in the feels @Denton Nelson

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 2:23 PM
Anyone that is properly pinkie up uses Oxford.

Bryant Jackson, Yesterday 2:23 PM
Yeah, but the real question is what does @Toby Whipple think about all this?

Paul Willey, Yesterday 2:26 PM
As I've already addressed dictionary definitions are based on the most common usage, not the only usage.

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:27 PM
you still havent shown proof that your usage is used by anyone other than you

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 2:28 PM
^^ I have never seen 'fact' used in any other way than the dictionary definition.

Trevor Gurney, Yesterday 2:28 PM
also, click the "see more" button below that Paul and you get the rest of the definitions for Set

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 2:28 PM
Also, any good dictionary (Oxford) will cover alternate uses.

Everett Baird, Yesterday 2:28 PM
what if we went back even further and said where is this coming from, paul? what is your point?

lets boil it down

bring it back

Toby Whipple, Yesterday 2:29 PM
@Bryant Jackson the person you are trying to contact is not available at this time please hang up and try again later.

Ryan Marchant, Yesterday 2:29 PM
lmao

That is golden

Paul Willey, Yesterday 2:39 PM
My point Everett is that when we were still talking about Fusion Reactions I was defending my arguments with things that could be tested and proven whether or not I'm wrong, while the majority of the arguments against me were basically "You're wrong".

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 2:45 PM
But If you're wrong that's all the argument needed.

Logan Burr, Yesterday 2:46 PM
that is not at all what my argument was xD

Paul Willey, Yesterday 2:47 PM, Edited
Denton, Not if the basis for me being wrong is "LOL, No."

Richard Manseau, Yesterday 2:47 PM


Paul Willey, Yesterday 2:47 PM
Logan you didn't add anything to the discussion of Fusion.

Denton Nelson, Yesterday 2:48 PM
The basis of you being wrong was that you were arguing that Terra was wrong by arguing against things that she didn't say.

Logan Burr, Yesterday 2:48 PM
I contradicted your own argument about fusion

Bryant Jackson, Yesterday 2:50 PM


Ryan Marchant, Yesterday 2:51 PM
This will be the world record of a thread

Logan Burr, Yesterday 2:52 PM
Ryan, focus on your call

Paul Willey, Yesterday 3:11 PM
Logan you did no such thing, you made a strawman of my argument seen here;

Ryan Marchant, Yesterday 3:12 PM
I am always focus

Paul Willey, Yesterday 3:13 PM, Edited
Even based on your strawman my argument is still stronger than you make it seem. Even if I was appealing to authority (which I wasn't).

Everett Baird, Yesterday 3:19 PM
again lets not sidestep the actual point: fusion, if we left it where it is, would be worth nothing. it can't be used bc it's not efficient enough. great

but we have the ability to improve things

therefore the first step was amazing

Logan Burr, Yesterday 3:20 PM
Yea, this conversation is over. Nothing anyone says will change Paul's opinion.

Paul Willey, Yesterday 3:28 PM
Not when the opposing arguments are Fallacies propped up by sarcasm...

Logan Burr, Yesterday 3:28 PM
Paul. we are done with this conversation

period
